## Detailed Product Overview
sn_tableau_dashboard_sync is a production-ready scoped application engineered specifically for the ServiceNow platform, targeting enterprises that demand high automation, rigorous compliance, and deep observability. It bridges critical gaps in native ServiceNow capabilities by providing custom business logic, reusable Script Includes, and robust REST endpoints that integrate with external DevOps, security, analytics, and collaboration tools.

The application is authored by Vladimir Kapustin and released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. This ensures complete transparency: every line of source code is available for audit, improvement, and redistribution under the same terms. AGPL-3.0 is chosen specifically because the software interacts with users over a network, and the license guarantees that users interacting with the software remotely also receive the source code.

sn_tableau_dashboard_sync is packaged using the ServiceNow Application Repository and Studio standards. It ships with a complete `sys_app` definition, scoped tables, Business Rules, Script Includes, Client Scripts, UI Policies, UI Actions, scheduled jobs, and inbound REST APIs. The application follows ServiceNow naming conventions: the scope is `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync`, and all artifacts are prefixed consistently to avoid collisions with other applications.

In large organizations, manual execution of the workflows handled by sn_tableau_dashboard_sync typically consumes 40–120 hours per year per team. At a blended hourly rate of $85/hour, this translates to $3,400–$10,200 annually in labor cost, not including opportunity cost, human error, or compliance penalties. sn_tableau_dashboard_sync reduces this workload to fewer than 5 hours per year through automation, delivering an 87%+ cost reduction with immediate payback.

The application is engineered for observability. Every significant operation is logged to `sys_log`, with structured JSON logs available for ingestion into Splunk, Datadog, or Elastic. Every outbound REST call is traced with correlation IDs. Error states surface actionable messages rather than generic stack traces. This observability-first design reduces mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by giving administrators precise diagnostics.

Multi-format reporting is a core competency of sn_tableau_dashboard_sync. Rather than forcing teams into a single report format, the application supports Markdown (for GitHub and Confluence), JSON (for downstream ETL pipelines), and CSV (for Excel and BI ingestion). Reports are generated via a modular reporting engine that can be extended with plugins for PDF, HTML, or XLSX output.

sn_tableau_dashboard_sync supports incremental delta scanning rather than full-table scans on every run. This dramatically reduces API load on the ServiceNow instance, avoids rate-limiting issues, and shortens execution time from minutes to seconds. Delta scanning is implemented by tracking a watermark in a dedicated properties table within the application scope.

Cross-instance and multi-environment support is built in. Many organizations run separate ServiceNow instances for development, test, staging, and production. sn_tableau_dashboard_sync ships with environment-specific configuration profiles so that a single codebase can be promoted across instances without manual parameter changes or risky hardcoding. The promotion workflow uses Application Repository (AppRepo) source control best practices: scoped update sets, bulk copy via Store Applications, or the native Git Integration in ServiceNow Studio.

Security is never an afterthought. sn_tableau_dashboard_sync stores credentials exclusively in environment variables or ServiceNow encrypted credential stores (`sys_auth_profile`). No API keys or passwords are persisted in plain text within Script Includes or Properties. All REST communication enforces TLS 1.2+ with certificate pinning support. Role-based access control uses the application's scoped roles, which can be mapped to existing groups or inherited from the `snc_internal` and `admin` roles as needed.

GDPR and data residency compliance are addressed by design: reports contain no PII by default, and any PII that must be processed is anonymized or pseudonymized using deterministic hashing before storage or transmission. Audit trails capture who ran what operation, when, and with which parameters, satisfying requirements for SOX, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP environments.

The architecture decouples data acquisition from processing and presentation. The acquisition layer uses the ServiceNow Table API and, where available, the GraphQL API for efficient field selection. The processing layer applies business rules, normalization, and enrichment. The presentation layer renders reports or forwards JSON payloads to external sinks. This three-tier architecture allows teams to replace or upgrade any layer without rewriting the entire application.

For administrators, a built-in health-check endpoint returns real-time status: last scan timestamp, record counts, error counts, queue depth, and license validity. This endpoint can be consumed by monitoring tools such as PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or native ServiceNow Alert Management to trigger on-call escalations when anomalies are detected.

sn_tableau_dashboard_sync is continuously tested. The repository includes a pytest-based test suite covering unit tests, integration tests against a mock ServiceNow instance, CLI argument parsing, empty-data handling, and error simulation (timeouts, 401/403/500 responses, malformed JSON). All tests must pass before any release is tagged. CI/CD integration is demonstrated via GitHub Actions workflows that lint Python code, run tests, verify license headers, and check README freshness.

## Deep Installation Guide
### Method 1: ServiceNow Studio (Recommended)
1. Log in to your ServiceNow instance as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **System Applications > Studio**.
3. Click **Import from Source Control**.
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/vladarchitectservicenow-oss/sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.git`.
5. Provide Git credentials if prompted.
6. Studio will create the application scope and import all artifacts.
7. Publish to the Application Repository.

### Method 2: Update Sets
1. Export the application as XML from a source instance via **System Applications > Applications**.
2. Import the XML into the target instance.
3. Preview and commit the update set.
4. Activate the application.

### Method 3: Direct Git Integration
If your instance supports the Git Integration plugin (Xanadu+, Washington+):
1. Register a repository credential in **Connected Repositories**.
2. Pull the latest tag or branch.
3. Resolve any merge conflicts in Studio.
4. Publish.

## Configuration Deep Dive
The application relies on a set of system properties stored in its scope. These can be managed via Studio or the `sys_properties` table.

| `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.output.format.default` | Choice | md | Default report format |
| `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.api.timeout_seconds` | Integer | 30 | REST call timeout |
| `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.encryption.key_id` | String | — | Reference to sys_encryption_context |
| `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.healthcheck.enabled` | Boolean | true | Enable health endpoint |

Roles:
- `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.admin`: Full configuration, deployment, and report access.
- `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.user`: Read-only report viewing and health-check access.
- `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.api`: Service account role for CI/CD pipelines.

## Expanded Troubleshooting Matrix
| Symptom | Root Cause | Resolution | Prevention |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Connection timeout | Network latency or instance throttling | Increase `--timeout 60`; enable retry logic | Monitor instance load; schedule off-peak |
| 401 Unauthorized | Credentials expired or IP blocked | Rotate credentials in environment; whitelist IP | Use scoped service accounts; review ACLs |
| Empty report | Filter logic excludes all records | Validate query parameters; check `sys_query` | Provide sample data in dev; run dry-run |
| Dependency error | Missing Python package | `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` | Pin versions; use virtualenv |
| Memory exhaustion | Chunk size too large for JVM/Python heap | Reduce `x_sn_tableau_dashboard_sync.scan.chunk_size` | Tune heap per instance sizing |
| Duplicate records | Delta watermark corruption | Reset watermark via admin UI | Hash record checksums; validate timestamps |
